0571199917,['Stuart Spencer'],"An accessible, contemporary guide to the art of dramatic writingDuring the ten years that Stuart Spencer has taught playwriting, he has struggled to find an effective playwriting handbook for his courses. Although most of the currently popular handbooks have good ideas in them, they all suffer from the same problems: they're poorly organized; are composed mostly of quirky, idiosyncratic advice on how specific playwrights have gone about writing their own work; and are full of abstract theorizing on the nature of art. As a result, they fail to offer any concrete information on how to construct a well-written play or any useful guidelines and exercises. Moreover, few of these books are actually written by working playwrights. Out of frustration, Spencer wrote his own book. The result, The Playwright's Guidebook, is a clear, concise, and engaging handbook. Spencer addresses the important principles of structure, includes insightful writing exercises that build upon one another, explores the creative process, and troubleshoots recurrent problems that playwrights actually face.",3eabf4e796a227460ea754e03cdcc00f833dd1c3ee6dc3a4f90a0095e7355cc0,N/A,978-0571199914,"March 29, 2002",2002,amazon,The Playwright's Guidebook: An Insightful Primer on the Art of Dramatic Writing,https://www.amazon.com/Playwrights-Guidebook-Insightful-Dramatic-Writing/dp/0571199917/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SXZRM8A5WAXoBPEInhsFJKr45Ce8OGLzS5grJ7_OekFvaUHTfDTRTmVOCsJBUQEcPtVmMcRMAgDO-fcb8ZqXvYe6GTzJqCzhETGbkkuqB70.3NCSLFKmKYxL-jYI2awm4HtrqOrEIM7TqMEEL1eFleo&dib_tag=se&keywords=Playwright+Python&qid=1749169362&sr=8-7

1400248353,['Justin Evans'],"Data is not about number crunching. It’s about ideas. And when used properly (read: ethically), it is the problem solver of our time.Yet many savvy people seem to be in data denial: they don’t think they need to understand data, or it’s too complicated, or worse, using it is somehow unethical. Yet as data and AI (just an accelerated way to put data to work) move to the center of professional and civic life, every professional and citizen needs to harness this power.In The Little Book of Data, each chapter illustrates one of the core principles of solving problems with data by featuring an expert who has solved a big problem with data—from the entrepreneur creating a “loneliness score” to the epidemiologist trying to save lives by finding disease “hotspots.”The stories are told in a fast-moving, vivid, sometimes comic style, and cover a wide frame of reference from adtech to climate tech, the bubonic plague, tiny submarines, genomics, railroads, bond ratings, and meat grading. (That’s right. Meat.)Along the way Evans injects lessons from his own career journey and offers practical thought-starters for readers to apply to their own organizations.By reading The Little Book of Data, you will achieve the fluency to apply your data superpowers to your own mission and challenges—and you will have fun along the way.You will be, in other words, a data person.",b77888e9908aa9c0b4856f2d5ecf08bdac0748efa1ebb2a4f97fbb820389da3a,1400248353,978-1400248353,"June 3, 2025",2025,amazon,"The Little Book of Data: Understanding the Powerful Analytics that Fuel AI, Make or Break Careers, and Could Just End Up Saving the World",https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Data-Understanding-Analytics/dp/1400248353/ref=sr_1_21_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.k2OZYGnsqQiylNPQQb8PiJyawpqP8fmoFypYjqmYZhl_dy0Hidyai9elPN9qIhmTYaqcVj53svNZfCp9jtJW7eLMK0TE0zR1_MjfLmSjpQBsfBpU5v2G8qRmBUWl5nAf7pjViyqS7-6KxzKFpdpAUC2LiaYE-qqAJJDjRgfo0smKRvJJJ2yuhgIKy4akIdDjknKsamDNKI_EuWq56dduNj4W5fh7VkHAtCNMxzx-nsE.AoXcJVwAVGN0u6cn611_RifPjO_CdRWLFjADH7ud4cI&dib_tag=se&keywords=Data+Science+with+Python&qid=1749169368&sr=8-21-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGY&psc=1
1119698723,['Dick Kusleika'],"Large corporations like IBM and Oracle are using Excel dashboards and reports as a Business Intelligence tool, and many other smaller businesses are looking to these tools in order to cut costs for budgetary reasons. An effective analyst not only has to have the technical skills to use Excel in a productive manner but must be able to synthesize data into a story, and then present that story in the most impactful way. Microsoft shows its recognition of this with Excel.  In Excel, there is a major focus on business intelligence and visualization.  Data Visualization with Excel Dashboards and Reports fills the gap between handling data and synthesizing data into meaningful reports.  This title will show readers how to think about their data in ways other than columns and rows.Most Excel books do a nice job discussing the individual functions and tools that can be used to create an ""Excel Report"".  Titles on Excel charts, Excel pivot tables, and other books that focus on ""Tips and Tricks"" are useful in their own right; however they don't hit the mark for most data analysts.  The primary reason these titles miss the mark is they are too focused on the mechanical aspects of building a chart, creating a pivot table, or other functionality.  They don't offer these topics in the broader picture by showing how to present and report data in the most effective way.What are the most meaningful ways to show trending?  How do you show relationships in data?  When is showing variances more valuable than showing actual data values?   How do you deal with outliers?  How do you bucket data in the most meaningful way?  How do you show impossible amounts of data without inundating your audience?  In Data Visualization with Excel Reports and Dashboards, readers will get answers to all of these questions. Part technical manual, part analytical guidebook; this title will help Excel users go from reporting data with simple tables full of dull numbers, to creating hi-impact reports and dashboards that will wow management both visually and substantively. This book offers a comprehensive review of a wide array of technical and analytical concepts that will help users create meaningful reports and dashboards.After reading this book, the reader will be able to:Analyze large amounts of data and report their data in a meaningful wayGet better visibility into data from different perspectivesQuickly slice data into various views on the flyAutomate redundant reporting and analysesCreate impressive dashboards and What-If analysesUnderstand the fundamentals of effective visualizationVisualize performance comparisonsVisualize changes and trends over time",9676400998cbf5124c2dc3ed129f382545c76385188fc96c3740d2ca9f420549,1119698723,978-1119698722,"February 17, 2021",2021,amazon,Data Visualization with Excel Dashboards and Reports,https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualization-Excel-Dashboards-Reports/dp/1119698723/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.k2OZYGnsqQiylNPQQb8PiJyawpqP8fmoFypYjqmYZhl_dy0Hidyai9elPN9qIhmTYaqcVj53svNZfCp9jtJW7eLMK0TE0zR1_MjfLmSjpQBsfBpU5v2G8qRmBUWl5nAf7pjViyqS7-6KxzKFpdpAUC2LiaYE-qqAJJDjRgfo0smKRvJJJ2yuhgIKy4akIdDjknKsamDNKI_EuWq56dduNj4W5fh7VkHAtCNMxzx-nsE.AoXcJVwAVGN0u6cn611_RifPjO_CdRWLFjADH7ud4cI&dib_tag=se&keywords=Data+Science+with+Python&qid=1749169368&sr=8-22-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGY&psc=1
